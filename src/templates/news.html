            <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">Fall 2020 plans</h1>
            <h2 style="font-size: 20px;">July 20 , 2020</h2>
            <p>On June 15, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences provided an interim report on fall planning efforts that
                outlined three possible pathways for how we might return students to campus. After careful deliberation,
                and informed by extensive input from our community, we write today to announce our plans to bring up to
                40% of our undergraduates to campus, including all first-year students, for the fall semester. Assuming
                that we maintain 40% density in the spring semester, <strong style="color: #780000;">we would again
                    bring back one class, and our
                    priority at this time is to bring seniors to campus. Under this plan, first years would return home
                    and
                    learn remotely in the spring. We also will invite back to campus those students who may not be able
                    to
                    learn successfully in their current home learning environment.</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                In making this consequential decision, we have been guided by the same core principles we established at
                the outset of this crisis: to put health and safety first, protect the academic enterprise, leverage our
                breadth and diversity, and preserve access and affordability. Some of the attributes that we most value
                about our campus are exactly the things that make adaptation to pandemic conditions particularly
                challenging. Our bustling urban environment, the ease of grabbing the T into Boston, our
                intergenerational residential communities that house 98% of our undergraduates, our global research
                community of students, faculty, staff, postdocs, and visitors from around the worldâ€”Q was built
                for connection, not isolation. Without a vaccine or effective clinical treatments for the virus, we know
                that no choice that reopens the campus is without risk. That said, we have worked closely with leading
                epidemiologists and medical experts to define an approach that we believe will protect the health and
                safety of our community, while also protecting our academic enterprise and providing students with the
                conditions they need to be successful academically.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong style="color: #780000;">Q University is eager to welcome students and scholars back to campus and
                    recapture the residential
                    liberal
                    arts and sciences experience that is core to our identity.</strong> In our planning efforts, we have
                sought a
                path to bringing all students back as soon as conditions allow, while continuing their academic progress
                in the meantime and remaining a vibrant research community across our broad range of disciplines. But we
                also recognize that, fundamentally, there is an intrinsic incompatibility between our highly
                interactive, residential Q University College experience and the social distancing needed to mitigate
                COVID-19 transmission. The recent upturn in COVID-19 cases in certain states illustrates the difficulty
                of making predictions, even well-informed ones, about the evolution of this virus. Given this
                uncertainty, we determined that our fall plan must enable us to bring back as many students as possible
                while providing sufficient margin to accommodate an escalation in the prevalence of COVID-19 in our
                area. Anything less and we could find ourselves again facing the prospect of asking our students to
                leave, on short notice, prior to the end of the semester. Given the constraints imposed by our existing
                housing inventory, we have made a decision that enables up to 40% of undergraduate students to learn
                from campus in appropriate accommodations, while retaining the ability to isolate and quarantine up to
                250 individuals at a time. Absent an effective vaccine or clinical therapy, this reduced density,
                together with a high-cadence viral testing program and universal adoption of public health practices
                such as face masks and frequent handwashing, is needed to safely host a significant number of
                undergraduates on campus. This finding is supported by extensive modeling by our public health experts.
                <br>
                <br>
                Choosing which students would be invited to campus was not easy, and we have enormous sympathy for
                sophomores and juniors as they consider the prospect of not starting their fall term in Cambridge. We
                could not help but recognize the unique position that first-year students find themselves in, making the
                transition to college in these strange times. They have not yet begun to build their Q University network of
                faculty, advisors, and friends or learn about life in the Yard. Even with the many adaptations that will
                be in place this fall, we see enormous value in having them on campus in our residential system. Though
                we are far from a decision about spring, as we describe below, making sure that seniors have their final
                semester on campus, to finish their thesis work and complete their four-year journey, is a priority we
                hold dear. With the experience of sophomores and juniors in mind, <strong style="color: #780000;">we
                    have decided to extend to
                    all
                    students who spend the year studying away from campus the opportunity to attend Summer School in
                    Cambridge without tuition charge in 2021.</strong> This program, described in more detail below, was
                designed
                also in recognition of the many international students and those with pre-existing medical conditions
                who may not be able to join us on campus during the academic year.</p>
            <h1 style="font-size: 20px;">REMOTE TEACHING AND LEARNING</h1>
            <p>The interim planning report established that all course instruction (undergraduate and graduate) for the
                2020-21 academic year will be delivered online. Students will learn remotely, whether or not they live
                on campus. With that in mind, we have taken the following steps: </p>
            <p><strong style="color: #780000;">Academic calendar and course scheduling</strong>: The fall term will
                begin as planned on
                September 2, 2020. The
                instructional day will be expanded to accommodate synchronous instruction across a range of time zones.
                The Registrar will soon issue guidance about fall semester course scheduling to the academic
                departments.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong style="color: #780000;">Excellence in remote teaching</strong>: As we work to prepare for the
                fall, we are guided by the
                recognition that
                the success of remote teaching depends on our ability to create and sustain strong connections among
                students and between students and faculty. Q Universityâ€™s learning technologists and specialists in
                innovative pedagogy are supporting faculty and teaching fellows in the development of fall courses and
                the design of activities and assignments that take advantage of the remote format and enable students to
                achieve key goals, including for hands-on learning in lab and art-making courses. We are increasing
                instructional support by recruiting graduate students as Bok Media and Design Fellows and Remote Support
                Teaching Fellows. The Bok Center has also designed its fall teaching conference to help teaching fellows
                prepare for their remote teaching responsibilities. More information about required instructor trainings
                and other remote ready resources is available online.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong style="color: #780000;">Excellence in remote learning</strong>: We are working to ensure that
                all students are prepared
                for remote
                learning. The Academic Resource Center has assembled dedicated remote learning resources and will be
                offering orientations to all incoming first-year undergraduate students.
                Grading: The emergency grading systems that were put in place in the spring semester will not continue
                into the fall semester. Fall courses for all students will return to regular grading.
                International students: Guidance for international students continues to evolve at a rapid pace. A town
                hall for international undergraduate students will be held on July 8 and the graduate student town hall
                meetings on July 7 and 8 will also include detailed information for international students. The latest
                guidance and resources are available from the Q University International Office. One of the reasons that we
                determined early in our process that we would rely upon remote instruction was that we expect many
                international students will encounter challenges entering the country given that consular offices are
                not processing F1 visas.</p>
            <h1 style="font-size: 20px;">LEARNING REMOTELY FROM CAMPUS</h1>
            <p>We know that students are eager to be on campus and we too are eager to return to full residential
                operations. Informed by a careful review of our residential capacity, the academic needs of our
                students, and guidance from public health experts, we have defined the group of undergraduate students
                who will be invited to learn from campus this fallâ€”first-year students and those who must be on campus
                to progress academically.
                <br>
                <br>
                All first-year undergraduate students will be invited to campus for the fall semester. This will enable
                first-year students to benefit from a supported transition to college-level academic work and to begin
                to build their Q University relationships with faculty and peers. Both online and dorm-based programs will be
                in place to meet these needs. Over the last few weeks, there has been frequent communication with our
                first-year students about their transition to Q University and this will continue as we approach the start of
                the academic year.
                <br>
                <br>
                We are committed to ensuring a secure and supportive learning environment for all students. While all
                courses will be taught remotely, we understand that some students may not be able to learn successfully
                in their current home learning environment. If a student believes they will have remote learning
                challenges this fall, we ask that they please complete this form by Monday, July 13. Student submissions
                will be reviewed by a committee of faculty and staff in order to identify what specific supports may be
                needed, including whether it may be necessary for a student to reside on campus.
                <br>
                <br>
                Accommodations in the Yard Dorms and the Houses will be adapted to meet new public health standards.
                Enrolled undergraduate students who will be learning remotely from campus will live in single bedrooms
                with a shared bathroom. Students will be distributed across the first-year dorms and a number of
                upper-class Houses in order to achieve a maximum residential density of 40%. The dorms and Houses are
                undergoing physical modifications to support our public health goals. These include enhanced cleaning
                schedules, personal safety training and protective equipment for custodians, security guards, and House
                staff, improved air handling and filtration in shared spaces, hand sanitizer and wipe stations, and
                signage outlining our public health community guidelines.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong style="color: #780000;">Campus access will be restricted to safeguard our communityâ€™s
                    health</strong>.There will be restrictions on
                inter-house access to dining areas and to non-residential Q University buildings, with the exception of
                Q  University Health Services. We hope to provide some access to athletic and recreational
                facilities, as part of our commitment to overall wellness, though guidance for that is not yet final. No
                off-campus visitors will be allowed into Q University buildings, and this will include enrolled Q University
                students who are not in residence on campus. With these measures in place, we are confident that we can
                support campus-based remote learning while also safeguarding our residential communityâ€™s health and
                safety.
                <br>
                <br>
                Move-in and move-out procedures and timelines will be different. While the academic calendar for the
                fall semester will not change, there will be additional considerations for students who will be learning
                remotely from campus. Students will receive instructions regarding the protocol for a phased arrival to
                campus prior to the start of the semester. All students will move out for the semester by November 22
                and will complete reading period and exam period from home. The standard process for granting exceptions
                will be followed.
                <br>
                <br>
                This decision has implications for our Athletics program. We anticipate that the Ivy League will issue a
                decision on July 8 about fall sports competitions and training. Even in the absence of this guidance, we
                acknowledge that our medium density plan will necessarily place limits on what athletic activities are
                possible at Q University this fall. An enhanced focus on wellness will be important for all members of our
                community. Wellness programming and resources will be developed by the Department of Athletics, Q
                University Health Servicesâ€™ Center for Health and Wellness, the Dean of Students Office and other
                partnering organizations.</p>
